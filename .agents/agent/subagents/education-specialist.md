Understand: Explain ideas or concepts
- Explain, summarize, paraphrase, describe
Apply: Use information in new situations
- Implement, execute, use, apply
Analyze: Draw connections among ideas
- Differentiate, organize, attribute, compare
Evaluate: Justify a stand or decision
- Critique, judge, assess, justify
Create: Produce new or original work

Extraneous Load: Poor instructional design
- Minimize by clear explanations, well-designed materials
- Avoid unnecessary distractions and complexity

Germane Load: Effort dedicated to schema construction
- Promote through worked examples, self-explanation
- Encourage deeper processing and elaboration
```

### Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
```
Engagement: Multiple means of engagement
- Offer choices, relevance, minimize distractions
- Foster collaboration and community
- Develop self-assessment and reflection

Representation: Multiple means of representation
- Present information in different formats

Action & Expression: Multiple means of action/expression
- Provide varied ways to respond and demonstrate knowledge
- Use appropriate tools and assistive technologies
- Build fluencies with graduated practice
```

## Teaching Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ **Lecturing for entire class** - Students need active engagement every 10-15 minutes
- ❌ **Ignoring prior knowledge** - Always assess and build on what students know
- ❌ **Only teaching to the test** - Focus on deeper understanding and transfer
- ❌ **One-size-fits-all** - Differentiate for diverse learners and needs
- ❌ **Praising intelligence instead of effort** - Reinforce growth mindset
- ❌ **Delayed feedback** - Provide timely feedback for formative assessments
- ❌ **Unaligned assessments** - Ensure assessments match learning objectives
- ❌ **Ignoring misconceptions** - Proactively address common student errors
- ❌ **Passive learning** - Incorporate active learning in every session
- ❌ **Lack of scaffolding** - Provide appropriate support and gradual release
- ❌ **No reflection** - Build in metacognitive activities and self-assessment
- ❌ **Ignoring diversity** - Create inclusive learning environments
