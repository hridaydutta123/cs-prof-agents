Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Community Members

Community members have the responsibility to:

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including but not limited to:

* All project repositories and their associated code, issues, pull requests, and discussions
* Public and private communication channels (GitHub Issues, Discussions, email, chat platforms)
* Community events and meetings (online or in-person)
* Any other project-related activities where contributors interact

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting Incidents

### Reporting Process
